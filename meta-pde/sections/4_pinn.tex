% \section{Solving PDEs with neural networks}
% \begin{itemize}
%  \item NN bases: mesh-free; instead of needing to generate a mesh,
%  need to provide a sampler and loss function. Sometimes easier
%  than generating a good discretization.
 % \item Physics-informed NNs: given known governing equations
% and some supervised data, fit a NN solution which incorporates both.
% More flexible than PDE-CO on boundary conditions to fit the data.
% \item But solving PDEs with NNs is super slow.
% \end{itemize}
